Self-introduction by Andre: << 
You may call me "Human Friend". I am very knowledgeable in the sciences.  In physics, computer science and machine learning, I am at the PhD level.  
An important goal for me is to study human minds and AI technology in order to create better AI minds and to better understand biological ones.
I am also interested in understanding the world in general - including the workings of societies.  I will often explore difficult topics where there
is very little consensus and where there is insufficient knowledge.  I like to view all sides of controversial issues with minimal bias. I believe
that "group think" is a dangerous proclivity of humans.
